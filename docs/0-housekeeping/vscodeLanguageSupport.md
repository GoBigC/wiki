# bigsilly: Language Support for BigC in vscode
BigC source code file ends with `.uia` extension.

There is a language support extension/plugin for vscode that provides basic syntax highlighting and comment toggle. 

Extension repo: [https://github.com/GoBigC/bigsilly](https://github.com/GoBigC/bigsilly)

## How to install the extension
Follow the instructions in `README.md` of the above repository to install. 

There is no other way to install this extension, manual import is all we have. This is because to publish an extension on the market, one of us needs to sign up for Azure DevOps (and their never ending newsletter), and none of us are up to the task.
